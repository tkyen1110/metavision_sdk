5.2 License Fee. In consideration and as full and final compensation of the Developers access right granted to SOFTWARE number of copies set forth in the License Agreement, the License and the services provided by PROPHESEE, LICENSEE agrees to pay PROPHESEE: an access right lump sum upfront amount whose amount is detailed in the Quotation (“License Fee”). This License Fee is neither refundable, cancellable nor transferable even if LICENSEE decides to exert none of the licensing rights granted herein.

5.3. Royalty Fee. In consideration of the sub-license granted by PROPHESEE to the LICENSEE pursuant to Section 2.1. (d) above, the per unit royalties fees (“Royalty Fee”) whose amount is detailed in the Quotation for any and each unit of Device sold by the LICENSEE to End-Users and each Device sold by End-Users, being understood and agreed by the Parties that if at least one Device is commercially sold by LICENSEE and/or any End-Users as embedding a part of the Device Software, then the Royalty Fee is due for each unit of Device.

5.3.1. Subject to Section 2.1 provisions and before any part of the Device Software is integrated into a new Device and/or licensing rights are granted to an End-User on a part of the Device Software, LICENSEE shall provide PROPHESEE with written notification defining (a) the date of first Device Software shipment and the Device Software access rights granted from LICENSEE to End -Users; and (b) the name and location of the End-User; and (c) information allowing to identify and track such Device and Device Software type, such as e.g. description of a camera imaging processing chip, geographical areas where such Device type will be commercially available.

5.3.2. During the production period of Devices, within fifteen (15) days after the end of each quarter, LICENSEE will provide PROPHESEE with a sales report stating the number of units of Devices shipped to End-Users and the number of Device Software licensed to End-Users as well as the number of units of Devices sold by End-Users during the preceding quarter.
Once PROPHESEE has received and checked the reported information, PROPHESEE will issue an invoice to charge LICENSEE the Royalty Fee for the units reported for such quarter based on the agreed Royalty Fee per unit as set in the Quotation, computed and aggregated from the Effective Date. The fact PROPHESEE issues an invoice based on LICENSEE’s units report shall not operate to void any right for PROPHESEE to conduct any further audit for such period as expressed in Section 5.6 below.
Should LICENSEE fail to provide PROPHESEE with such report in due time, PROPHESEE shall charge LICENSEE a provisional amount corresponding to the highest previous reported quarter.

Each payment hereunder shall be made by LICENSEE to PROPHESEE by wire transfer within thirty (30) days of LICENSEE’s receipt of an invoice; therefore, it is agreed by the Parties that the date of an invoice sent in pdf file format attached to an electronic mail is considered as the date of such receipt. Should LICENSEE fail to provide PROPHESEE with its quarter reports in due time, LICENSEE payment terms will be reduced accordingly in order to avoid delaying the actual date of payment to PROPHESEE which would otherwise have been applicable.

All amounts payable by LICENSEE under this Agreement shall be paid in Euros, US Dollars or in RMB, in accordance with the currency as set forth in the License Agreement, net of all fees (including but not limited to any bank, transfer and exchanges fees).

On top of these recovery costs, LICENSEE shall pay interest to PROPHESEE on the aggregate amount of any payments that are not paid on or before the date such payments are due under a License Agreement, at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank in its latest refinancing operation plus ten per cent (10%) from the due date of such payment, or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, calculated on the number of days such payments are paid after the date such payments are due. In the event of failure to make payment when due under the License Agreement, PROPHESEE shall be entitled, without prejudice to its other rights and remedies, to terminate the License Agreement with neither liability nor compensation due to the LICENSEE.

5.5. Taxes. All customs and excise duties, import and/or export duties and other taxes, tariffs and surcharges of any nature whatsoever now or hereafter levied or imposed in any country or territory, either directly or indirectly, in respect of the License and supply of Support Services shall be borne by the LICENSEE and are payable in addition to the compensation as above.

5.6. Verification of quantities. LICENSEE will keep for a period of at least four (4) years all records needed to count, compute, review and verify the Royalty Fee or the Substitution Fee due to PROPHESEE under this Agreement.

LICENSEE warrants that it complies with the ABC Regulations and further warrants that it has not granted and shall not grant, directly or indirectly, any gift, present, payment, remuneration or benefit whatsoever aiming at getting or as counterpart to the License Agreement and its performance. In the event of failure to comply with this clause, PROPHESEE shall automatically have the right to terminate the License Agreement without compensation to the LICENSEE and without prejudice to any remedies PROPHESEE may claim to the LICENSEE as consequence thereof.

With respect to any transfers of restricted Items from LICENSEE to PROPHESEE, LICENSEE will be the exporter of record and responsible for obtaining any export licenses required in connection therewith. In all cases, LICENSEE will communicate to PROPHESEE, at the latest at the time of export, the applicable export control classification number (ECCN) and whether the Item is subject to US export or reexport controls in order to allow PROPHESEE to comply with its obligations under this License Agreement. LICENSEE warrants that it will, over the course of the License, timely provide PROPHESEE with complete and accurate information and documentation necessary to ensure compliance with applicable export controls, such as identification of the intended End-User, end-use and country of destination of Items procured from PROPHESEE.
